# 🗺️ Grid Path Search Lab
*Find paths through 2D grids using search algorithms*

## What You'll Learn
Compare BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* algorithms for pathfinding in grid mazes.

## 🎯 The Problem
Find the shortest path from start (S) to goal (G) while avoiding obstacles (█):

```
S . . . G    
█ █ . █ .    
█ . . . .    
█ . █ █ .    
. . . . .    
```

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Open** `grid_search_lab.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. **Run each cell** step by step
3. **Watch** algorithms find paths and compare performance
4. **Experiment** with different grids in the last cell

## 🔍 Algorithms Implemented
- **BFS**: Finds shortest path, explores many nodes
- **DFS**: May find longer paths, uses less memory  
- **UCS**: Optimal for weighted graphs
- **A***: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic, most efficient

## 📋 What You'll See
The notebook includes:
- **2 test grids**: Simple 3×3 and maze 5×5
- **Performance comparison**: Path length, nodes explored, time taken
- **Visual path display**: See the solution path on the grid

## 💡 Key Questions
After running the lab, ask yourself:
1. **Which algorithm found the shortest path?**
2. **Which explored the fewest nodes?** 
3. **Why is A* more efficient than BFS?**
4. **When might you use each algorithm?**

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand search algorithm trade-offs
- See how heuristics improve efficiency
- Compare optimal vs non-optimal algorithms
- Practice algorithm analysis
