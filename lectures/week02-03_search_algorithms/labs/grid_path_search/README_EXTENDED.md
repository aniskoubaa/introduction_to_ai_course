## üéØ **Problem Definition**

### **Grid Representation**
```python
# 0 = passable cell (cost = 1)
# 1 = obstacle (impassable)
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # S . . . G
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # ‚ñà ‚ñà . ‚ñà .
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # ‚ñà . . . .
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],  # ‚ñà . ‚ñà ‚ñà .
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # . . . . .
]
```

### **State Space**
- **State**: Position (row, col) in the grid
- **Initial State**: Start position, e.g., (0, 0)
- **Goal State**: Target position, e.g., (0, 4)
- **Actions**: Move up, down, left, right (4-connected)
- **Path Cost**: Number of steps (each step costs 1)

## üîç **Algorithm Details**

### **1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
```python
def bfs(self, start, goal):
    queue = deque([start])      # FIFO queue
    visited = {start}           # Avoid revisiting states
    parent = {start: None}      # For path reconstruction
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()  # Explore oldest node first
        
        if current == goal:
            return self.reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)
        
        for neighbor in self.get_neighbors(current):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] = current
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return None  # No path found
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Completeness**: Always finds solution if one exists
- **Optimality**: Guarantees shortest path (minimum steps)
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b=branching factor, d=depth
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^d) - stores all nodes at current level
- **Best for**: Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs

### **2. Depth-First Search (DFS)**
```python
def dfs(self, start, goal, max_depth=50):
    stack = [(start, 0)]        # LIFO stack with depth tracking
    visited = {start}           # Avoid cycles
    parent = {start: None}      # For path reconstruction
    
    while stack:
        current, depth = stack.pop()  # Explore newest node first
        
        if current == goal:
            return self.reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)
        
        if depth < max_depth:  # Prevent infinite search
            for neighbor in reversed(self.get_neighbors(current)):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    parent[neighbor] = current
                    stack.append((neighbor, depth + 1))
    
    return None  # No path found or depth limit reached
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Completeness**: Complete with depth limit, incomplete without
- **Optimality**: Does NOT guarantee shortest path
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^m) where m=maximum depth
- **Space Complexity**: O(bm) - only stores current path
- **Best for**: Memory-constrained environments, when any solution suffices

### **3. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**
```python
def ucs(self, start, goal):
    pq = [(0, start)]           # Priority queue: (cost, position)
    costs = {start: 0}          # Best known cost to each state
    parent = {start: None}      # For path reconstruction
    visited = set()             # Processed states
    
    while pq:
        current_cost, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current in visited:
            continue  # Skip if already processed optimally
        
        visited.add(current)
        
        if current == goal:
            return self.reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)
        
        for neighbor in self.get_neighbors(current):
            new_cost = current_cost + 1  # Each step costs 1
            
            if neighbor not in costs or new_cost < costs[neighbor]:
                costs[neighbor] = new_cost
                parent[neighbor] = current
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor))
    
    return None  # No path found
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Completeness**: Always finds solution if one exists
- **Optimality**: Guarantees lowest-cost path
- **Time/Space Complexity**: O(b^(C*/Œµ)) where C*=optimal cost, Œµ=minimum cost
- **Best for**: Weighted graphs where step costs vary

### **4. A* Search**
```python
def astar(self, start, goal):
    h_start = self.manhattan_distance(start, goal)
    pq = [(h_start, 0, start)]  # Priority queue: (f_cost, g_cost, position)
    g_costs = {start: 0}        # Actual cost from start
    parent = {start: None}      # For path reconstruction
    visited = set()             # Processed states
    
    while pq:
        f_cost, g_cost, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current in visited:
            continue
        
        visited.add(current)
        
        if current == goal:
            return self.reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)
        
        for neighbor in self.get_neighbors(current):
            tentative_g = g_cost + 1
            
            if neighbor not in g_costs or tentative_g < g_costs[neighbor]:
                g_costs[neighbor] = tentative_g
                parent[neighbor] = current
                h_cost = self.manhattan_distance(neighbor, goal)
                f_cost = tentative_g + h_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (f_cost, tentative_g, neighbor))
    
    return None  # No path found
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Evaluation Function**: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
  - g(n) = actual cost from start to n
  - h(n) = heuristic cost from n to goal
- **Heuristic**: Manhattan distance |x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ| + |y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ|
- **Admissibility**: Heuristic never overestimates actual cost
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed if heuristic is admissible
- **Efficiency**: Often explores far fewer nodes than BFS/UCS
- **Best for**: Optimal pathfinding with guidance toward goal

## üìä **Performance Analysis**

### **Algorithm Comparison Matrix**

| Criteria | BFS | DFS | UCS | A* |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Completeness** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No* | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Optimality** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes** |
| **Time Complexity** | O(b^d) | O(b^m) | O(b^C*) | O(b^d) |

| **Speed on Grids** | Medium | Fast | Medium | Very Fast |

*With depth limit  
**If heuristic is admissible

### **When to Use Each Algorithm**

1. **BFS**: When you need the shortest path and can afford memory usage
2. **DFS**: When memory is limited and any solution is acceptable
3. **UCS**: When step costs vary and you need optimal cost
4. **A***: When you need optimal paths efficiently and have a good heuristic

---

## üß† **Key Concepts**

### **Heuristic Functions**
A heuristic function h(n) estimates the cost from node n to the goal.

**Manhattan Distance for Grids:**
```python
def manhattan_distance(self, pos1, pos2):
    return abs(pos1[0] - pos2[0]) + abs(pos1[1] - pos2[1])
```

**Properties:**
- **Admissible**: Never overestimates true cost (required for A* optimality)
- **Consistent**: h(n) ‚â§ cost(n,n') + h(n') for every neighbor n'
- **Informative**: Closer estimates lead to better performance

### **Search Tree vs State Graph**
- **Search Tree**: Shows the exploration process, can have duplicate states
- **State Graph**: Shows unique states and their connections
- **Visited Set**: Prevents exploring same state multiple times

### **Path Reconstruction**
```python
def reconstruct_path(self, parent, start, goal):
    path = []
    current = goal
    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = parent.get(current)
    path.reverse()
    return path
```
