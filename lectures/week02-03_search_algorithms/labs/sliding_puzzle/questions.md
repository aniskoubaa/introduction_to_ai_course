# 8-Puzzle Search - Practice Questions

## üß† **Theoretical Questions**

### **1. State Space Understanding**
1. **State Representation**: Why do we use tuples instead of 2D arrays to represent puzzle states?

2. **State Space Size**: How many possible states exist in the 8-puzzle? Are they all reachable from any given starting state?

3. **Branching Factor**: What's the average branching factor for the 8-puzzle? How does it vary based on empty space position?

4. **Goal Testing**: How do we efficiently check if a state is the goal state?

### **2. Heuristic Functions**
1. **Manhattan Distance**: Calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic for this state:
   ```
   1 2 3
   4   6  ‚Üí  Goal: 1 2 3
   7 5 8           4 5 6
                   7 8
   ```

2. **Misplaced Tiles**: Calculate the misplaced tiles heuristic for the same state above.

3. **Admissibility**: Prove that both heuristics are admissible (never overestimate).

4. **Dominance**: Which heuristic dominates the other? Why does this matter for search efficiency?

### **3. Algorithm Analysis**
1. **BFS Guarantee**: Why does BFS guarantee the shortest solution in terms of number of moves?

2. **DFS Problems**: Why is DFS generally not suitable for puzzle solving without modifications?

3. **A* Optimality**: Under what conditions does A* guarantee optimal solutions?

4. **Memory Trade-offs**: Compare memory usage between BFS and A* with Manhattan distance.

## üß© **Manual Solving Exercises**

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7   8
```
Goal state:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8
```

1. **Manual Solution**: Solve this by hand. How many moves did it take?
2. **BFS Trace**: What states would BFS explore in order?
3. **A* Trace**: Calculate f(n) = g(n) + h(n) for the first 3 states A* explores.

### **Exercise 2: Heuristic Calculations**
For this puzzle state:
```
8 1 2
  4 3
7 6 5
```

Calculate step by step:
1. **Manhattan Distance** for each tile
2. **Total Manhattan Distance**
3. **Number of Misplaced Tiles**
4. **Which heuristic gives a better estimate?**

### **Exercise 3: State Generation**
Starting from:
```
1 2 3
4   6
7 5 8
```

1. **List all possible moves** (neighboring states)
2. **Apply Manhattan distance** to each neighbor
3. **Rank neighbors** by their heuristic values
4. **Predict** which neighbor A* would explore first

## üíª **Programming Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Algorithm Enhancement**
Modify your implementations to:
- **Track** the actual sequence of moves (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Implement** iterative deepening search
- **Add** a custom heuristic function of your design

### **Challenge 2: Performance Optimization**
Optimize your code for:
- **Faster state generation**
- **More efficient heuristic calculation**
- **Better memory usage**

### **Challenge 3: Solvability Check**
Implement a function to determine if a puzzle state is solvable:
- Count inversions in the puzzle
- Apply the solvability rule for 8-puzzle
- Test with various starting configurations

### **Challenge 4: Larger Puzzles**
Extend your implementation to work with:
- **15-puzzle** (4√ó4 grid)
- **24-puzzle** (5√ó5 grid)  
- **Custom sized puzzles**

## üéØ **Hands-On Analysis**

### **Experiment 1: Algorithm Comparison**
Using the provided test cases, measure and compare:

| Metric | BFS | A* (Manhattan) | A* (Misplaced) | DFS |
|--------|-----|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Nodes Explored | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Time (ms) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Memory Usage | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Solution Length | ? | ? | ? | ? |

### **Experiment 2: Heuristic Effectiveness**
For 10 different random starting states:
1. **Count nodes explored** by A* with each heuristic
2. **Calculate average improvement** of Manhattan over Misplaced tiles
3. **Find cases** where one heuristic significantly outperforms the other

### **Experiment 3: Difficulty Analysis**
Create puzzles of increasing difficulty:
- **Easy**: 2-4 moves to solve
- **Medium**: 8-12 moves to solve  
- **Hard**: 20+ moves to solve

Analyze how algorithm performance changes with difficulty.

## üîç **Debugging Scenarios**

### **Bug Hunt 1: Infinite Loop**
This code has a bug that causes infinite loops:
```python
def buggy_bfs(initial_state):
    queue = deque([initial_state])
    # Bug: Missing visited set
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == goal_state:
            return current
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current):
            queue.append(neighbor)
```
**Question**: Why does this cause infinite loops? How do you fix it?

### **Bug Hunt 2: Wrong Heuristic**
This heuristic function is not admissible:
```python
def bad_heuristic(state):
    # Bug: This can overestimate
    return manhattan_distance(state) * 2
```
**Question**: Why is this inadmissible? What problems will it cause for A*?

### **Bug Hunt 3: Memory Leak**
This A* implementation uses excessive memory:
```python
def memory_hungry_astar(initial_state):
    open_list = []
    closed_list = []  # Bug: Should use set, not list
    # ... rest of implementation
```
**Question**: What's the problem and how do you fix it?

## üìä **Advanced Analysis Questions**

### **State Space Properties**
1. **Reachability**: From the goal state, what's the maximum number of moves needed to reach any reachable state?

2. **Symmetries**: How do puzzle symmetries (rotations, reflections) affect the search space?

3. **Parity**: Explain why exactly half of all possible 8-puzzle configurations are unsolvable.

### **Algorithm Behavior**
1. **Best Case**: What type of puzzle configurations make A* most effective?

2. **Worst Case**: When does A* perform similarly to BFS?

3. **Heuristic Design**: Can you design a heuristic better than Manhattan distance?

### **Real-World Connections**
1. **Pattern Databases**: How could you use precomputed patterns to improve search?

2. **Bidirectional Search**: How would searching from both start and goal help?

3. **Learning**: How could machine learning improve puzzle solving?

## üìù **Implementation Variations**

### **Variation 1: Different Goal States**
Modify your code to solve for different goal configurations:
```
Goal A: 1 2 3    Goal B: 8 1 2
        4 5 6            7   3  
        7 8              6 5 4
```

### **Variation 2: Weighted A***
Implement weighted A* where f(n) = g(n) + w√óh(n):
- Test with w = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0
- Analyze speed vs. optimality trade-offs

### **Variation 3: Beam Search**
Implement beam search with limited memory:
- Keep only the k best states at each level
- Test with different beam widths (k = 5, 10, 20)
