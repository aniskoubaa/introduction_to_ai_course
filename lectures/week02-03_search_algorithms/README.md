# Week 2-3: Search Algorithms

## üìö Module Overview

This two-week module provides a comprehensive introduction to search algorithms in AI, covering both uninformed and informed search strategies. Students will learn to formulate problems as search problems and implement various algorithms to solve them efficiently.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students should be able to:
- Formulate problems as search problems (state space, actions, goal test)
- Understand and implement uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS)
- Understand and implement informed search algorithms (Greedy, A*)
- Design and evaluate heuristic functions
- Analyze time and space complexity of search algorithms
- Apply appropriate search algorithms to different problem domains
